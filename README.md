# DNA Damage Response:
Investigating the signaling dynamics of the tumor suppressor p53 using live cell imaging, time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms to quantify DNA damage responses at the single-cell level. These findings suggest a novel role of the p53-p21 network in quantitatively encoding DNA damage strength and fine-tuning proliferation behavior.
